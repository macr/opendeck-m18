# OpenDeck VSD Inside M18 / Mirabox M18 Plugin

An unofficial plugin for VSD Inside M18 / Mirabox M18 devices.

**This is a fork of [opendeck-akp153](https://github.com/4ndv/opendeck-akp153) by Andrey Viktorov (st.lynx), adapted for the M18 device.**

## OpenDeck version

Requires OpenDeck 2.5.0 or newer

## Supported devices

- VSD Inside M18 (5548:1000)
- Mirabox M18 (6603:1009)
- Mirabox M18 EN (6603:1012)

## Device Layout

The M18 has:
- 15 LCD keys (5 columns x 3 rows)
- 3 bottom buttons (non-LCD, mapped to keys 16-18 in OpenDeck)

**Note:** OpenDeck displays a 4x5 grid (20 slots), but the M18 only has 18 physical buttons. The last 2 slots in the bottom row are unused and do not correspond to any button on the device.

## RGB LED Control

The M18 has 24 RGB LEDs:
- 22 LEDs around the device edges
- 2 LEDs on the bottom row (between buttons)

### LED Layout

```
21 20 19 18 17 16 15
22                14
1                 13
2                 12
3   23       24   11
4  5  6  7  8  9  10
```

### Set LED Color Action

Use the "Set LED Color" action to customize LED colors:

1. Add the action to any button in OpenDeck
2. In the Property Inspector, click on each LED to select its color
3. Use "Apply to All" to set all LEDs to the same color
4. Colors are saved locally and automatically reapplied when the device reconnects

## Platform support

- Mac: Best effort, may need testing
- Windows: Not tested, contributions welcome
